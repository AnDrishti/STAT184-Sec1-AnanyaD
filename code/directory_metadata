# Directory Metadata for Code Folder

This folder contains R script files used for data processing, analysis, and transformation in this project. Below is an overview of the contents:

- **Files:**
  - `USArmedForces.R`: An R script that processes raw data from the `US-ArmedForces-untidy.csv` file into a tidy format suitable for analysis. 
  This script performs the following steps:
    1. Loads necessary R packages (`rvest`, `tidyverse`, `dplyr`).
    2. Reads the raw CSV file containing military personnel data.
    3. Cleans and transforms the data:
       - Removes unwanted columns.
       - Renames columns for clarity.
       - Handles missing values by replacing them with `0`.
       - Filters out unnecessary rows based on specific criteria.
       - Pivots the data into a tidy format for analysis.
       - Splits composite columns into separate variables and trims any extra whitespace.
    4. Outputs the processed dataset for further use or analysis.

- **Purpose:**
  This directory is dedicated to scripts that automate data manipulation and analysis tasks. It ensures reproducibility and efficiency when handling project datasets.

- **Notes:**
  As the repository evolves, additional scripts may be added to this folder to extend functionality or support other aspects of the project. This document should be updated to reflect such changes.
